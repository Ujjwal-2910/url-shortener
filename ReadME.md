# URL Shortner

<br>
It is a URL shortener web application<br>
To use it you have to Clone the code in your project<br>
Install NodeJS from the browser and create a database in MongoDB atlas<br>
Create a ```.env``` file in root directory and add 2 variables 'mongodbConnect' which stores the url to your database and 'PORT' which and store your desired port<br>
Do `npm i` in to download all the required packages<br>
type `npm start`on terminal and then go to your desired port by typing this and replace your port instead of < PORT >`localhost:< PORT >` on browser<br>
type the url and press on `GO` to get a unique code<br>
`localhost:3001/< unique_id >`<br>
replace the unique id you got instead of < unique_id > and see the magic, you will redirect to your the url you gave as input<br>
